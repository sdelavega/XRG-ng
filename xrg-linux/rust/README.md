# Linux Swift / Rust transition

This is the GTK 4 replacement in progress. It runs alongside the C/GTK3 application
in `../src`; the C executable and its `~/.config/xrg-linux/settings.conf` remain
available. The new executable is `xrg-ng-linux`, version 0.1.0. It currently shows
aggregate CPU, memory, network receive/send and physical-disk read/write graphs.
This is an initial vertical slice, not feature parity with the C application.

## Construction

- **Shared Swift:** the *same source files* compile into macOS's XRGCore target and
  the root Swift package, XRGSharedCore. Ring buffers retain Accelerate on macOS
  and use Swift arithmetic on Linux. Rate tracking, Claude/Gemini/Codex/local
  provider parsers, METAR decoding and the six macOS theme palettes are shared.
  AppKit, macOS collectors, Objective-C selectors and XTF archives stay in XRGCore.
- **C ABI:** `Shared/Bridge/XRGCBridge.swift` exports versioned `@c` functions;
  `Shared/include/xrg_shared.h` documents ownership and capacities. No C
  implementation or shared Swift/Rust object layout is required. The first ABI
  exposes histories, rates, themes, local metrics and individual Codex records.
  Claude/Gemini/METAR sources compile in the package but are not exposed to Rust yet.
- **Rust:** owns `/proc` and `/sys` collection, GTK4/Cairo drawing, configuration and
  lifecycle. A worker creates/owns all mutable Swift handles. It sends only copied
  Rust snapshots through a single latest-value slot; GTK touches them on its main
  thread. No shell commands, provider scans or collection run in drawing callbacks.
- **Themes:** all six shared presets are selectable. The new UI saves the selection
  atomically in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xrg-ng/settings.conf` (or `~/.config/xrg-ng`). It
  does not import or modify the old C application's settings or theme files yet.

CPU calculations exclude guest time already included in user/nice. Memory uses
MemAvailable. Network aggregates non-loopback interfaces (bridges/VPNs may count
traffic more than once); disks aggregate whole non-loop/ram/zram/dm/md devices to
avoid counting partitions and stacked devices twice. Rates use elapsed monotonic
time and the shared reset/saturation policy. Disk/network labels show read/receive
first, write/send second. First CPU sample waits for an interval. Failed collection
shows an error and retains previous history rather than recording fabricated zeros.

## Build and run

On Linux install **Swift 6.3+** (CI: 6.4.1), **Rust 1.99.1**, pkg-config, a C compiler
and **GTK 4.10+** development libraries. GTK4-rs is locked through Cargo.lock. On
Ubuntu 24.04 the GTK package is `libgtk-4-dev`. The build script builds and links the
Swift package automatically. Native builds are required; setting a foreign Cargo
`--target` does not cross-compile the Swift side.

From the repository root:

```bash
swift test
cargo test --manifest-path xrg-linux/rust/Cargo.toml --locked
cargo run --manifest-path xrg-linux/rust/Cargo.toml --features gtk-ui
cargo run --manifest-path xrg-linux/rust/Cargo.toml -- --headless --samples 3
bash Tools/ci-linux.sh debug
bash Tools/ci-linux.sh release
```

The core-only Cargo build also works on macOS without GTK, for FFI and parser tests.
Live collectors and the GTK application require Linux. Development binaries have a
build-directory rpath for XRGSharedCore; a distributable package must bundle or
install the matching Swift runtime and shared library. Moving the executable alone
is not a supported installation.

For isolated Linux validation on another host:

```bash
docker build -f xrg-linux/Dockerfile.swift-rust -t xrg-ng-linux-dev .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" xrg-ng-linux-dev
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" xrg-ng-linux-dev bash Tools/ci-linux.sh release
```

CI runs Swift tests, a C header/ABI executable, Rust formatting/Clippy/tests, three
live headless samples, and a GTK/Xvfb launch that requires multiple live samples
and actual Cairo draw callbacks. The GTK check switches Paper/Ocean presets and
exports a rendered PNG for inspection. Smoke mode does not read or write user preferences.
Xvfb uses Cairo, so this does not validate accelerated rendering, Wayland compositor
behavior, screen readers or physical-device collection. Linux build output is
separate from host Swift output when using a shared Docker checkout.

## Remaining migration

1. Rust GPU, battery, temperature, process and TPU collectors, with bounded optional
   external commands and hardware fixtures.
2. Connect the shared provider parsers to incremental Rust log/SQLite/network
   acquisition; expose Claude/Gemini and weather through the ABI when consumers land.
3. Per-core/interface/device selection, module visibility/order, context menus,
   detailed preferences, custom theme load/save and explicit legacy-settings import.
4. Wayland/X11 behavior and accessibility validation. GTK4 removed GTK3's global
   window placement / keep-above APIs; supported positioning/pinning needs a
   compositor-specific implementation. No always-on-top or edge-placement promise
   is made by this initial shell.
5. Runtime bundling, desktop integration, distribution packages and native x86_64 /
   ARM64 hardware verification before replacing the C application's release path.

GTK4 fits the rewrite: supported Rust bindings, modern scene-graph rendering and
retained Cairo drawing through GtkDrawingArea. GTK4 does not make blocking collectors
asynchronous; the separate worker is what keeps collection out of the UI loop.
